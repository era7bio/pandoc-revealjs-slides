## About

This is a template for creating slides using Pandoc markdown and reveal.js.

## Usage

First install [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8#installation), then run

```bash
g8 era7bio/pandoc-revealjs-slides
```

It will ask you some questions and then apply the template in the direstory named after the `name` placeholder that you just filled in.

Then you write source of the slides in markdown and compile it. See instructions in the inner `README.md`.
